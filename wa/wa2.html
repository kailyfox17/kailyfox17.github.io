        <p>Hello!</p>
        <h1>I am Kaily Fox (she/her)! I am from Chicago, but I love to hike and ski so I have throughly enjoyed my time in Colorado. I have the cutest dog named Barclay, who is a pitbull mix! I love dogs, hence the link to my favorite youtube video.</h1>
        <h2>I am excited to learn more about coding and expand my github knowledge!</h2>
