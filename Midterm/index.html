        Introduction: Who is Kaily Fox?
      </h1>
      <img src="images/businesspic.PNG" alt="placeholder" class="feature">
      <p>I am Kaily Fox, a current Senior at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am a finance major in the Leeds School of Business, along with a minor in Creative Design & Technology accompied with a certificate in Global Business. </p>

      <p>I have loved living in Boulder, Colorado the last four years. My time here has been filled with amazing adventures and opportunities that I am eternally grateful for. I will cheerish the friends met and the memories I have made for a lifetime.</p>

      <p>Throughout these last four years, I have become even a bigger fan of this state than I previously was. I love being outdoors, and Colorado provides almost no excuse to not. Boulder is filled with beautiful hiking spots and scenery that take my breath away each day. I also grew up skiing, so being able to have such easy access to some of the best resorts in the country is the biggest blessing. </p>

      <p>Now that my time in this amazing place has come to an end, it is time for me to start looking forward. I am orginally from a western suburb of Chicago and I plan to move back to the city after graduation. Although I do not know exactly what my next steps are, I am eager to start my career as a women in finance. I feel ready to be independent and make Chicago my own.</p>

      <p>I hope to combine my passions and skills to make a meaningful and successful career for myself. I hold myself to a high standard and I take pride in my work ethics and aspiration. With my personal qualities and all the valuable skills I have learned at CU, I feel ready for the next chapter of my life.  </p>

      <p>If you have any interest in knowing a little bit more about my professional background, I have attached my resume here.  </p>
